### Project Description
This project is basically giving your camera a super power. It can spot colours in real time like a detective on a mission! Using OpenCV and some smart colour filtering, it tracks objects based on their colour. 
### The Problem statement
We"re solving the ridiculous problem of losing things right in front of our eyes. This project uses computer vision to track objects by colour so you will never have to ask "where did I put that red notebook again?" Think of it as a tiny search robot for your everyday chaos.

### The Solution
We"re solving it by capturing real time video using OpenCV. The system converts the feed to hsv colour space and applies masking it to detect specific colours. Finally it highlights and tracks the object making it easier to locate!
